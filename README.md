# EE552-FinalProject-AppointmentCalendar
This repository is for the EE552-Engineering Programming:Java course, taught by Professor Frank Riccobono during the Spring 2023 Semester at Stevens Institute of Technology. The repository contains the code, files, and documentation for the Final Project - Appointment Calendar. 

# Appointment Calendar Project Requirements
My faculty mentor is a busy guy. In addition to managing his research projects he teaches several courses and has to maintain office hours for each of those courses. In a perfect world, those office hour times will not change from week to week, but sometimes conflicts may arise. Additionally, students can make appointments to see during his office hours. If too many students have requested the same time slot, he might not have time to see them all.

Itâ€™s important for his students to know when he is available, but because he is so busy, he wants to be able to quickly configure his calendar week-to-week.

## Mininal Requirements
* Design a simple text file format that can represent weekly availability windows
* Read that text file and use it to display a calendar view of the information
* Display this calender as HTNL over a network
* Allow users to reserve timeslots from the calendar as long as slots are available
* Calender can display how many slots are remaining

## Additional Feature Ideas
You may want to consider the following:
* Can you keep information confidential so that the professor can see who has requested appointments but other students will not know who else in the class is visiting during office ours?
* Can you send automated of upcoming office hours with the list of appointments?
